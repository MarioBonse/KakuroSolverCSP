# KakuroSolverCSP
Solver of the japanese game kakuro viewed as CSP problem.
You can write your problem.
It will find simplify the domain with NodeConsistency and generalArchConsistency algorithms. They will remove from the domains solution that can't satisfy the constraints. 
Then The solution will be then found with a backtracking algorithm.
Right now the view is very simple and provided by terminal (in order to develop the algorithm faster) but can be easly improved.
There some Kakuro test.
