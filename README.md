# KakuroSolverCSP
Solver of the japanese game kakuro viewed as CSP problem.
You can write you problem.
It will find use GeneralArchConsistency, NodeConsistency algorithm in order to simplify the domains.
Then The solution will be found with a backtracking algorithm.
Right now the view is very simple and provided by terminal (in order to develop the algorithm faster) but can be easly improved.
There some Kakuro test.
